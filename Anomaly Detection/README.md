Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, called outliers. Typically, this is treated as an unsupervised learning problem where the anomalous samples are not known a priori and it is assumed that the majority of the training dataset consists of “normal” data (here and elsewhere the term “normal” means not anomalous and is unrelated to the Gaussian distribution).
